# Platform

Platform uses SDL2, modern OpenGL, and is inspired by SFML and XNA.

### Roadmap

This is in order of priority.

In the interest of simplicity of API, some SFML concepts might not be implemented.
For instance, Transform is better handled as glm matrices. Most of the Window API
would be C++ wrappers over SDL2 API.
